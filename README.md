# Respond-to-an-Incident-Involving-an-Employee-Being-Compromised-Using-Wireshark-and-Volatility-

In this project, I investigated a potential security breach after a customer expressed concerns about a practice virtual machine (VM) they had downloaded from a compromised capture the flag website. I focused on identifying vulnerabilities exploited by threat actors, particularly through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which directed traffic to malicious IP addresses.

My key actions included:

1. **Vulnerability Assessment:** I evaluated the web applications on the VM for known vulnerabilities.
2. **Traffic Analysis:** I monitored network traffic to identify suspicious IP addresses.
3. **Impact Evaluation:** I assessed the potential risks to the customer's infrastructure.
